## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- [SASS/SCSS](https://sass-lang.com) - CSS preprocessor
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Responsive Web Design

### What I learned

Just practicing my CSS layout skill. I realized from my previous challenges that I was too focused on learning Javascript that I was neglecting some basic knowledge. I'm still planning to do more of these kinds of challenges until I'm comfortable with my skills.
